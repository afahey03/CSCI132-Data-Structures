1.) The constructors are:
    - Student();
    - Student(std::string name, int year);

2.) The member functions are:
    - void addCourse(std::string courseName); 
    - void printCourses(void) const;
    - void printInfo(void) const;
    - void setGradDate(int year);

3.) The data members are:
    - std::string name;
    - int gradDate;
    - std::string courses[6];
    - int numCourses;

4.) Public means everything is allowed to access, and private means only members of the same class can access

5.) The constructors and functions that are stubs are:
    - Student::Student(std::string name, int year)
    - void Student::printInfo(void) const
    - void Student::printCourses(void) const

6.) The variable name is s

7.) The default constructor is used to initialize this object

8.) The member functions invoked are
    s.setGradDate(yr);
    s.addCourse(course);
    s.printInfo();
    s.printCourses();

9.) The program asked me my graduation year and courses, which I entered until I entered done, and then nothing else.

10.) It prints my entered graduation year and the courses I entered.

Collaboration:
I asked Eugene how he created the greatStudent object
I explained to Michael how to loop through the courses[] array to print the courses
