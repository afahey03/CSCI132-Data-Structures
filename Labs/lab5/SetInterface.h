/** A Set holds a collection of items, where no item can appear more
 than once, and the order of items does not matter. If an item is
 already in the Set, attempting to add it again will do nothing.

 A Set is similar to a Bag, except items in a bag can be repeats.
 There is no getFrequencyOf() method for Set, as there is for Bag,
 because the frequency of an item in a Set is always 1.
 
 Note: As items are added and removed, the items can change
 position, so clients should not rely on the items staying in any
 particular fixed order. However, so long as the Set is not
 modified, the items will obviously not change positions, so it is
 okay to iterate over the items, so long as the Set isn't changed
 during the iteration. */
