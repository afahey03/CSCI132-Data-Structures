// Modified by Aidan Fahey
// 9/10/22
// Changed some data structures to make the program work more accurately
// Added a histogram variable
//
// Discrete event simulator for a grocery store, simulating customers who arrive
// at the store, pick up a basket, shop for a while, then go to a checkout lane
// to wait for a cashier, then give back their basket, then depart the store
// with their groceries. 
//
// We simulate only certain aspects of the scenario, and leave out other things:
//  - We only simulate 1 day worth of shopping, around 700 minutes.
//  - The simulation proceeds minute by minute, starting with t=0, t=1, t=2, etc.
//  - All customers are more-or-less identical, except that each customer has a
//    unique ID number, and each customer has a different (random) amount of
//    time they want to shop for before they are ready to check out. Once they
//    leave, customers don't ever return to the store.
//  - Each customer gets one basket. Each basket has a serial number and a "use
//    counter" to keep track of how many minutes the basket was in use by a
//    customer.
//  - We don't model food, purchases, prices, money, etc. So our simulated
//    customers don't actually buy anything, and the simulated baskets don't
//    actually hold any food.
//  - We don't simulate the store "closing." Instead, we just keep the
//    simulation running until all customers have left the store.
