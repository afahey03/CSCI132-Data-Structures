treeSort has the same efficiency for an in-order and a reverse-order array, neither of which are as good as it's
efficiency for a random array.

when n = 10
random:                     in order:                   reverse order:
29 comparisons, 59 copies   45 comparisons, 75 copies   45 comparisons, 75 copies

when n = 100
random:                       in order:                       reverse order:
663 comparisons, 963 copies   4950 comparisons, 5250 copies   4950 comparisons, 5250 copies
