Question 1: first = 0; last = 26 // target is above the twoThirds threshold, first becomes twoThirds + 1
            first = 18; last = 26 // target is between oneThird and twoThirds threshold, first becomes oneThird + 1 and last becomes twoThirds - 1
            first = 21; last = 22 // target is equal to twoThirds, return twoThirds
